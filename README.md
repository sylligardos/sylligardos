- 👋 Hi, I’m Emmanouil Sylligardos, a graduate student at the Computer Science Department, University of Crete. Additionally, I
work as a graduate fellow researcher at the Computational Vision and Robotics Laboratory (CVRL) at ICS, FORTH.
 
- 👀 I’m interested in Dancing and Skateboarding. Regarding Computer Science, I tend to work more with Machine Learning.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to research (which is almost a paradox I believe)
 
- 💞️ I’m looking for a PhD.
 
- 📫 You can reach me at sylligardo@ics.forth.gr (That is my professional email address at ICS, FORTH.)
