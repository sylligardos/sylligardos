- 👋 Hi, I’m Emmanouil Sylligardos, a graduate student at the Computer Science Department, University of Crete. Additionally, I
work as a graduate research assistant at the Computational Vision and Robotics Laboratory (CVRL) at ICS, FORTH.
 
- 👀 I’m interested in International Latin Dancing and Skateboarding. However, regarding Computer Science, I tend to work more with AI and specifically Deep Learning.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 and the Tensorflow and Keras libraries. However, since I'm easily getting bored I try to always
explore more than one thing at a time. Thus, I also learn OCaml in the university and I find it very interesting.
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any domain actually. I wouldn't like to restrict myself in a single subject already. However, I'm extremely interested
and motivated in projects that have an immediate impact to the world (e.g. AI & Medicine, AI to improve the lives of people with disabilities)
 
- 📫 You can reach me at sylligardo@ics.forth.gr (That is my professional email address at ICS, FORTH.)
